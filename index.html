            <h1><em>About Shivan</em></h1 >
            <p>I am a Interactive Media Design student currently in my first semester. I am very new to the back end of the computer. I have no prior knowledge of coding, but seeing as the world progresses it is becoming a more valubale skill. Not only in terms of employment opportunity but also in terms of understanding these devices we interact with every day.</p>
